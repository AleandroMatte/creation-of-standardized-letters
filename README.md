# creation-of-standardized-letters
just a simple automation project
this project is fairly simple,i've made a code that you'll have to manually insert a standardized letter and  adjust the code so it replaces 1 string that you want to replace and manually change the directory that it has to be saved on. I may update it in the future with the tkinter dialogs later, so you can choose where to save the file and what file do you want to change.
